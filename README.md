| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**DW_cert_monitor.sh**](./DW_cert_monitor.sh) | Validates SSL certificates and generates `.p12` bundles for Plex Media Server. |

| [**DW_convert_mkv.sh**](./DW_convert_mkv.sh) | Monitors a folder looking for unconverted Linux ISOs, copies them to a local folder, determines whether the file is 1080p or 4K and converts the file using HandBrakeCLI before copying back to the network for further sorting. |
| [**DW_merge_forced_subtitles.sh**](./DW_merge_forced_subtitles.sh) | Syncs media files with external subtitles and remuxes to MKV with "Forced" flags set. |
| [**DW_mkv_set_eng.sh**](./DW_mkv_set_eng.sh) | Checks mkv files in $1 and sets audio and subtitles to English if they are unset. |
| [**DW_monitor_convert.sh**](./DW_monitor_convert.sh) | Monitors folders for unconverted media, detects resolution (1080p/4K), and transcodes via HandBrakeCLI. |
| [**DW_monitor_movie_subtitles.sh**](./DW_monitor_movie_subtitles.sh) | Monitors $SOURCE_DIR for mkv files and processes the audio and subtitles, keeping English subs for non-English audio and stripping non-forced subtitles from English audio. |
| [**DW_move_movies_synology.sh**](./DW_move_movies_synology.sh) | Monitors the movies folder on the secondary server (synology) and checks the primary (truenas) for duplicates (indicating a REPACK) and moves them. |
| [**DW_move_tv_shows_synology.sh**](./DW_move_tv_shows_synology.sh) | Monitors the tv shows folder on the secondary server (synology) and checks the primary (truenas) for duplicate show folders (indicating a REPACK or new episodes) and moves them. |
| [**DW_scan_corrupt_media.sh**](./DW_scan_corrupt_media.sh) | Scan directories in $1 looking for corrupted media files, marking an issue in Seer. |

## 🚀 Key Workflows

### 1. Syncing Local Edits to GitHub
Use this when you've modified a script on your server and want to back it up to your repository.
```bash
sudo ./git_push.sh <filename.sh>
```
Metric Standards: Logs and measurements (file sizes, temps) utilize metric units (MB/GB/°C).

Self-Cleaning: If no actual changes are detected, the script resets the index to prevent "dirty" rebase errors.

### 2. Deploying to System / Updating Services
Use this to move a script from the repo folder into the system path and restart its background service.

```bash
sudo ./git_pull_install.sh <filename.sh>
```
Use this to move a script from the repo folder into the system path (for scripts that run manually or in cron).

```bash
sudo ./git_pull.sh <filename.sh>
```
Service Mapping: Automatically maps script_name.sh to script_name.service.

Lifecycle: Automates cp, chmod, daemon-reload, and systemctl restart.

🛠 Installation & Requirements
Setup on a New Machine

### 3. Clone the repository
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/danwooller/arr_scripts.git ~/arr_scripts
cd ~/arr_scripts
```
### 4. Set permissions
```bash
sudo chmod +x *.sh
```
### 5. First-time Push (Configures GitHub Auth)
When prompted, use your GitHub Username and Personal Access Token (PAT)
```bash
sudo ./git_push.sh git_push.sh
```
System Requirements
Git:
```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```
Systemd: Standard on Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian.

⚙️ Service Configuration Template
When creating a new background service, use this logic within your .service files to ensure compatibility with git_pull_install.sh:

Ini, TOML
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Service for %i
After=network.target

[Service]
User=dan
Group=dan
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
📝 Troubleshooting
Logs: View live service output: journalctl -xefu <service_name> -f

Permissions: If a script fails to run, verify ownership: ls -l /usr/local/bin/

Git Conflicts: If git_push.sh fails due to remote changes, the script is designed to fetch and reset --hard to ensure your local environment stays synced with the "source of truth" on GitHub.
